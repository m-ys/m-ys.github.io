    <p>2. <br> In "Mail Art and the Big Monster from Second Thoughts," Ulises Carrión ponders how "mail art" is constituted from "mail" and "art," and what meanings each part may hold to the whole. Mail art is complex because of the different forms that recipients, workers, mediums, and other aspects of the system may take as they fulfill different roles as either part of the "mail" or as part of the "art." Carrión suggests that there is a Monster in the system (which could be any part of the system, whether it's the technology, the people involved, or the medium), and that the mail art necessarily interacts with the Monster because a response is integral to the art, or so it may seem. I think this piece would be more meaningful to an artist or reader who already holds their own understanding of what mail art is and how they understand it, because the piece seems to ask more philosophical questions akin to "what is art?" (but instead, "what is mail art?"). An unfamiliar reader can only nod in cursory understanding of the author's words. <br> <br>
        3. <br> In these selections, Laurel Schwulst and Édouard U. discuss our own identities as creators and knowledge-seekers alongside our use of the internet and the way we interact with modes of information. I found Schwulst's metaphors of artist websites to be really interesting because what my website is and what I want it to represent or communicate is something I spend a lot of time thinking about. It feels like there's a lot of freedom in the way Schwulst views the website-- to me, while personal websites may be representations of the self, it's very different from meeting and interacting with the person themself because, while dependent on the creator, it exists independently, and a viewer can spend infinite time making their own interpretations of the site and its contents. <br>
        I also feel that Édouard U.'s idea of reading networks often happens naturally in the world we live in today-- we might be in the middle of a novel but head out to dinner and read an article on our phone on the way there, or in the way intersperse our classwork with other activities. <br> <br>
        4.<br>  In the Conclusion and Afterword of Post-Digital-Print, Alessandro Ludovico & Florian Cramer discuss the tensions and complexities of print and digital media for tradition, expression, and liberation. I felt a bit called out when I read "In one camp, we have the usual web, network-culture and new-media evangelists; on the other side, people (usually from a fine-art or graphic-design background) who feel passionately about the tangible, material qualities of print," but I think the points made were very fair. Although much of my work takes place on internet networks and communities and is indeed created digitally, there is a sensory draw to the physical and the print. The digital is associated with the rapid pull towards the future development of technology, while the print is pulled backwards into a sense of nostalgia, but I think they rather do coexist in transitional state (as Ludovico writes); what Cramer calls a "false dichotomy." Much of the technological also gets pulled into the nostalgic-- for example, floppy disks, cassette tapes, and even CDs-- while artists continue to develop new methods of expression via print. A hybrid, in some ways, seems like an only natural development. <br><br>
        5. <br>In Olia Lialina's article, she analyzes the archives of Geocities, what can be learned from such a significant archive of a significant and unique "place" of the past, and what it says about internet, time, and community structure.  I think it's really interesting how interconnected and interdependent a lot of things are on the internet even now, and it's pretty common to encounter a broken link or missing file. It's a fascinating to consider how shutting down a website like Geocities impacted so many other things, and the potential damage that taking down the c.gif file might cause. Also, I was curious and looked up geocities.co.jp, and it looks like it was shut down fairly recently in March 2019. It might have to do with how Yahoo! is actually still quite popular in Japan as Yahoo!Japan is a SoftBank subsidiary and operates independently from Yahoo!.  Marshasgraphics.com seems to be a health and wellness blog that hasn't been updated since 2014. I also think that many our generation still have some sense of nostalgia from these dead sites and descriptions, despite first using the internet around the later 2000s. <br> <br>
        6. <br>
        Seth Price's "Dispersion" discusses what is art and what makes something art when it is situated, created, or presented outside of "normal" contexts, and what it means when art is created and distributed in the digital age. I really enjoyed reading and looking all of the examples that he discussed, and how different meanings take form. I thought the typesetting and layout of the text kind of speaks to the idea of unconventionality and conventionality. It also made me think about what "conceptual art" really means, since it is indeed something a lot of people identify with but it seems few really have a specific (or at least the same) associated meaning with it. It's interesting to think about how AI fits into this picture-- is it an artist, a tool, a medium, a distributor; and is it art? <br><br>
        8. <br> The selections from "Alt-Text as Poetry Workbook" makes me think that this is another place where "medium" really matters, in this case being where the image is hosted and the greater context in which it is a part of. For example, a news site would do with a more concise, objective description whereas there is a lot more leeway on something more personal or creative, like a social media post or a piece of art. But it also seems that creative things might benefit from even more "objective" description because they stem from a personal image that artist conveys through their piece, and the mental image that a description would evoke could take many different forms. I think it was really interesting to read the different examples of "alt-text as poetry" because you can really "hear" the personal voices of each author. It's interesting to think that even people who do not necessarily require alt-text may still have things to gain from reading it in the case that a creator wrote it for their own creation (for example, what they emphasize or describe at all, suggesting a greater importance).<br><br>
        9. <br> I think the concept of surface + sign = graphic design is a really interesting way of framing the design and communication work. Yesterday I was talking to a friend about interests in product design rather than graphic design, and they made an comment about "making tangible things" rather than "things on the internet." I think this sort of flip that Duvall notes about the internet becoming the core of our ("afk") life rather than the other way around and how we frame how we view certain forms of creating and communication is really interesting. The way that Duvall delves into "hyperlinked meaning" and Disney symbolism shows how the process is at once both complex and reductive, in signified meanings and in graphic form, respectively.<br><br>
        10. <br> This week's reading was really interesting in how it talked about computer systems in education and the accessibility (or lack thereof) required in it. It made me think of the computer labs in elementary school and how we were taught to interact with them. The text brought to my attention many of the issues with code and accessibility, which I never thought much about (because I didn't code much, or interact with it much), but I do think about the affordances of different languages and text scripts a lot. The shape and orientation can have a lot of influence in how things can be arranged or placed, in graphic design as well. What I thought of, however, were physical objects. Chinese was traditionally written and read left to right and top to bottom. Now there are still many books with vertical text read from right to left, but there are also many books or signs that are now written right to left, horizontally. I find it particularly interesting when it's a sign, and it's only a couple of horizontal characters. As for how you know or can tell what's the proper way to read things (right to left or left to right, mostly, since vertical/horizontal orientation is quite easy), apparently you just see which way makes sense. Obviously more modern signs are more likely to be read right to left, as opposed to historical signs. This is all to say that I think the idea of globalizing or "colonizing" text is something that we see outside of just the digital, too. <br> <br>
        12. <br> This reading made me think about how physicality changes when things occur both in person and through a virtual interface, and how familiar things (such as string games like Cat's Cradle) can take a different form when presented in new mediums and new interfaces. I found Tuer's description of Frenkel's projects in "realiz[ing] a space in between conceptual and technological affirmations of presence" where there were changing dynamics of virtual interconnectivity striking. Particularly, the descriptions of Frenkel's projects and the ideas behind them encourages contemplation about what it really means to be connected and what reality means in spaces where things live in the "virtual" but occur (or have occurred) in the "real," and how technology enables types of interactions unavailable before. <br><br>
        13. <br> This week's reading ponders the meaning of a "post" and a "feed" and the networks formed by dynamic posting and watching across space and time. There is an interesting mix of an exploration into origins, histories, semantics, and metaphors. The section on ""the continuous feeds" and distanced watching" reminded me of a conversation with a friend. They described it (livestreams mostly, but also YouTube videos) as a very "parasocial" type of activity and it really makes me think about how human relationships are framed and reframed across these networks in different ways, and consider what it really means to take part in such an activity. I definitely agree it warrants deep consideration, but I don't think it's quite as dystopian (or utopian) as one might think. <br> <br>
        14. <br> "Beyond Dark Matter" discusses the often unspoken histories and power structures behind technologies, particularly of computing. I liked the presentation style but it definitely felt a bit simplistic and convoluted at the same time. I do think the messaging makes sense but it didn't resonate with me, I think (granted I'm not necessarily in the same context, situation, or environment as Gem). It's an interesting technique to use The Beyond and The Way as a method of starting a conversation about our personal and broader relationships with technologies, but from our readings so far I think the general message is to be cognizant of the things you use and the broader contexts that surround them.  <br> <br>
